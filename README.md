# Welcome to RadarCNN
This is a hobbyist project where I try to understand Radar and implement ML (deep learning) to radar processing.

This repo contains simple radar simulations and CNN model for signal modulation classification.

## Convolutional Neural Network
The following are CNN models trained on DeepRadar2022 dataset on kaggle.

The samples include 23 different modulation types with a -10 to 10db SNR applied.

## Radar Simulations
The following are visualisations of concepts from "EW 101: A First Course in Electronic Warfare" by David L. Adamy
